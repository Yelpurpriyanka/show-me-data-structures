## 5. Explanation Blockchain exercise
"A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list." ->
That made me think about off course a linked list with a detail of the previous
node giving us fast look up to a node only with the hash

Time and Space Complexity
* Append -> O(1)
* get hash -> Get a Node from a hash value
* size -> O(1) -> return len(self.blocks)
