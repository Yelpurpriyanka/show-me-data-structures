## 4. Explanation Active directory exercise

Almost the same as File recursion, the difference here is that we had to check 
if a list contains something and return true or false

Time and Space Complexity:
* O (n * m) -> iterating among m times per each n initial group
* Space -> O(1) -> we do not require data structures for saving data -> just return True or False
