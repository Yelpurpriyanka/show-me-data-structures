## 3. Explanation Huffman Coding exercise
```Note: This fucking exercise was amazing, took me like 2 or 3 days of thinking and a lot of research and keyboards, but finally I made it work :) Feels great```


### How I did it?
I made a lot of visualization, also hand crafted ones, and then I found a pattern, not sure if that
is how is in the books or is the pro way (I found one on my own).

* Frequencies array created and sorted and Nodes(Frequency, Char)
* on the lower frequencies making pairs of nodes and creating  a bunch of trees
* if n_of_frequencies % 2 != 0 -> take already created trees and append it to the tree
* with the rest of the frequencies
    - each (frequency, char) is added to a one of each of the trees created previously
    - if len of this frequencies > len trees -> new trees are created in pairs and appended to trees

* at the end with a bunch of trees and all chars in right position
    - sort trees based on root node value reversed
    - append trees 1 .. n to tree 0
    - ENCODING TREE BUILT
    
    
Time and Space complexity:
* Encoding -> O(n^2)
* Decoding -> O(n^2)
