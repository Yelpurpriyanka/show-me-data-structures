## 6. Explanation BlockChain exercise
* Union -> just iterate over both list, and add each node to a new LinkedList
* Intersection -> Iterate Over List2 1 time per item in list1, check whether or 
not an item of list 1 exists in list 2, if True -> append to a new linked list

Time and Space complexity:
* Union -> O(n + m) being n list1, m list2
* Intersection -> O (n + m + p) being n list1, m list2, p (append to intersected list)
