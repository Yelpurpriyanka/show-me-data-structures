## 5. Explanation Blockchain exercise
"A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list." ->
That made me think about off course a linked list off course, but taking into account that is not required
to make fast deletions and insertions, only appends, an array works perfectly

Time and Space Complexity
* Append operation in arrays takes O(n) being n the number of blocks ```chain = [Block(0, datetime.now(), "First Block", "0")]```
